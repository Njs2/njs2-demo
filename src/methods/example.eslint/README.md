## ESLint Example

### Steps

1. ESLint has been added as part of the project template
2. When you run ```njs2 run``` the linter goes to the concerned ```.js``` files inside the ```src``` folder and runs the code against the rules defined
3. The rules are coming from an Custom made ESLint Plugin for Njs2 Framework which can be used freely outside Njs2 too!
4. For now all the Lint rules are configured to throw warnings as at this moment the Njs2 Framework will only Warn the Developer and not forces them to solve
